It is also used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold or flu. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by blocking your body's production of certain natural substances that cause inflammation. This effect helps to decrease swelling, pain, or fever.If you are treating a chronic condition such as arthritis, ask your doctor about non-drug treatments and/or using other medications to treat your pain.

Do not give this medication to a child younger than 2 years unless directed by the doctor.Check the ingredients on the label even if you have used the product before. The manufacturer may have changed the ingredients. Also, products with similar names may contain different ingredients meant for different purposes. Taking the wrong product could harm you.\n",

       "> *   **Physical Therapy:** Begin physical therapy sessions to learn proper crutch use, gait training, and initial strengthening exercises.\n",

       "> *   **Advanced Strengthening:** Increase the intensity and complexity of strengthening exercises, incorporating more functional movements that mimic daily activities and sports-specific actions.\n",
       "> *   **Plyometrics:** Introduce plyometric exercises (jumping, hopping) gradually to improve power and explosiveness.\n",
       "> *   **Sport-Specific Training:** If the patient is an athlete, start incorporating sport-specific drills and exercises to prepare for a return to play.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Long-Term Prevention of ACL Re-tear:**\n",

       "> *   **Proper Technique:**  Ensure the patient uses proper techniques during sports and activities, especially when pivoting, cutting, and landing.\n",
       "> *   **Warm-up and Cool-down:** Always emphasize proper warm-up before activity and cool-down afterward to prepare the muscles and prevent injuries.\n",

The primary goal of this protocol is to protect t he reconstruction and while steadily progressing \\ntowards and ultimately achieving pre -injury level of activity.  Please note this protocol is a guideline .  Patients \\nwith additional surgery (i.e. collateral ligament repair ) will progress at dif ferent rates.  Achieving the criteria of \\neach phase should be emphasized more than the approximate duration.  If a patient should develop an increase \\nin pain or swelling or decrease in motion at any time, act ivity should be decreased until problems are res olved.  \\n \\nPHASE I :  0-2 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVE  \\n \\nGOALS:  \\nâ€¢ Progressive decrease in swelling  \\nâ€¢ AROM:  0 â€“ 90 degrees  \\nâ€¢ Prevent post -op knee stiffness'])"
